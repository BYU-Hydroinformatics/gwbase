# Results Overview

This section presents the key findings from the groundwater-baseflow correlation analysis in the Great Salt Lake Basin.

## Summary of Findings

### Spatial Patterns

The analysis reveals significant spatial variability in groundwater-streamflow relationships across the Great Salt Lake Basin:

- **Strong correlations** are observed in alluvial valleys with well-connected aquifer systems
- **Weaker correlations** occur in mountainous areas with complex hydrogeology
- **Seasonal variations** in correlation strength reflect different hydrologic processes

### Temporal Analysis

#### Seasonal Patterns
- **Spring**: Highest correlation coefficients due to snowmelt-driven recharge
- **Summer**: Moderate correlations with irrigation effects
- **Fall**: Variable patterns depending on precipitation
- **Winter**: Generally weaker correlations due to reduced recharge

#### Long-term Trends
- Multi-decadal analysis shows varying correlation strength over time
- Climate cycles (drought/wet periods) influence groundwater-streamflow relationships
- Anthropogenic impacts become more apparent in recent decades

## Key Metrics

### Well-Gage Relationships

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Total wells analyzed | ~6,000 | Wells with sufficient data |
| Wells paired with gages | ~1,200 | Wells within catchments of terminal gages |
| Mean distance to stream | 2.5 km | Average well-to-nearest-reach distance |
| Correlation range | -0.8 to 0.9 | Range of correlation coefficients |

### Data Quality Metrics

| Quality Indicator | Percentage | Impact |
|-------------------|------------|---------|
| Wells with >10 measurements | 45% | Suitable for trend analysis |
| Wells with >5 years of data | 32% | Adequate for seasonal analysis |
| High-quality gages (reference) | 28% | Minimal anthropogenic influence |
| Synchronized observation periods | 78% | Overlapping well-gage data |

## Correlation Analysis Results

### Strong Positive Correlations (r > 0.6)
- Concentrated in valley floor locations
- Associated with shallow, unconfined aquifers
- Typically within 1 km of streams
- Higher in areas with minimal flow regulation

### Moderate Correlations (0.3 < r < 0.6)
- Most common relationship type
- Found across various hydrogeologic settings
- Often associated with intermediate depths to groundwater
- Seasonal variability in correlation strength

### Weak/No Correlations (r < 0.3)
- Common in upland areas
- Associated with deep or confined aquifers
- Areas with significant flow regulation
- Wells far from stream networks

## Seasonal Analysis

### Spring (March-May)
- **Median correlation**: 0.52
- **Range**: -0.3 to 0.85
- **Dominant process**: Snowmelt recharge and runoff
- **Spatial pattern**: Strong correlations in mountain-front areas

### Summer (June-August)
- **Median correlation**: 0.38
- **Range**: -0.5 to 0.75
- **Dominant process**: Irrigation return flows and ET
- **Spatial pattern**: Variable, influenced by water management

### Fall (September-November)
- **Median correlation**: 0.41
- **Range**: -0.4 to 0.72
- **Dominant process**: Precipitation-driven recharge
- **Spatial pattern**: Depends on autumn precipitation patterns

### Winter (December-February)
- **Median correlation**: 0.29
- **Range**: -0.2 to 0.68
- **Dominant process**: Limited recharge and baseflow recession
- **Spatial pattern**: Weaker correlations basin-wide

## Hydrogeologic Controls

### Aquifer Type Effects
- **Alluvial aquifers**: Generally higher correlations (median r = 0.58)
- **Bedrock aquifers**: Lower correlations (median r = 0.31)
- **Mixed systems**: Intermediate correlations (median r = 0.44)

### Distance Controls
- Wells within 500m of streams show strongest correlations
- Correlation strength decreases exponentially with distance
- Threshold distance ~2-3 km for meaningful correlation

### Elevation Effects
- Valley floor wells show strongest correlations
- Mountain wells show weaker, more variable correlations
- Elevation gradient affects timing and magnitude of responses

## Implications for Water Management

### Groundwater Monitoring
1. **Optimize well networks** based on correlation patterns
2. **Focus monitoring** in areas with strong GW-SW connections
3. **Consider seasonal patterns** in sampling strategies

### Streamflow Prediction
1. **Use groundwater data** to improve low-flow forecasting
2. **Incorporate seasonal correlation patterns** in models
3. **Account for distance-decay relationships**

### Water Rights and Allocation
1. **Consider conjunctive use** in areas with strong correlations
2. **Recognize seasonal variability** in GW-SW interactions
3. **Account for spatial heterogeneity** in management decisions

## Data Limitations and Uncertainties

### Temporal Coverage
- Irregular sampling intervals for groundwater data
- Short overlap periods for many well-gage pairs
- Missing data during critical periods (droughts)

### Spatial Representation
- Uneven spatial distribution of monitoring wells
- Limited coverage in some catchments
- Potential bias toward accessible locations

### Measurement Quality
- Varying precision of historical measurements
- Potential effects of well completion changes
- Land use changes affecting local hydrology

## Future Research Directions

1. **Process-based modeling** to understand mechanisms
2. **Integration of remote sensing data** for broader coverage
3. **Climate change impact assessment** on GW-SW correlations
4. **Machine learning approaches** for pattern recognition
5. **High-frequency data analysis** where available
