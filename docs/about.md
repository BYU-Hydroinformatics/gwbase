# About

## Project Goals

Quantify groundwater-streamflow relationships in the Great Salt Lake Basin using:
- 120+ years of well data
- USGS stream gage measurements  
- Advanced spatial analysis methods

## Study Area

**Great Salt Lake Basin, Utah**
- 22,000 square miles
- Major rivers: Bear, Weber, Jordan, Provo
- Complex snowmelt-dominated hydrology

## Key Methods

1. **Delta metrics**: Change-based correlation analysis
2. **PCHIP interpolation**: Gap-filling for sparse data
3. **Network topology**: Stream-well spatial pairing
4. **Seasonal analysis**: Quarterly correlation patterns
